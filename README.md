# Schedulr

Schedulr is a web application built using Ruby on Rails backend and React and Redux frontend. It is built for the convenience of patients so they can book appointments without the need to call a receptionist. As long as there is an open slot available for a particular day and time, an appointment can be booked.

Get Started By running the rails server, you will be able to use the backend. Backend and frontend run on separate ports. 

Prerequisites You need to make a rails api using the new rails app command in the terminal. Then, use rails g model command to create models needed. After that, rails g controller command was used to create controllers and their corresponding views.
