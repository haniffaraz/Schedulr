# Schedulr

A Web Application that allows users to book appointments to various health providers, all online. No more wasting time and calling various providers to find an appointment that works for you. Schedulr allows you to see open slots for each provider on the platform and book an appointment with a click of a button. The app was built using ruby on rails as the backend and React and Redux as the frontend. Redux was used to manage global state.

Get Started By running the rails server, you will be able to use the backend. Backend and frontend run on separate ports. 

Prerequisites You need to make a rails api using the new rails app command in the terminal. Then, use rails g model command to create models needed. After that, rails g controller command was used to create controllers and their corresponding views.
